Final Project Ironhack 

Business Case
Music is with us on every aspect of our lives. It consoles us when we are sad, energises us when we want to be active or increases our productivity level while working. Being able to classify the mood of a song  is not only of great value for each one of us, but also an excellent business case as moods and emotions are important drivers for consumer purchasing decisions:
Music association: For many B2C companies (e. g. Fashion, Restaurants) music is part of their brand’s identify. Creating the right atmosphere and ambient with their customers can have a positive impact on their revenue
Currently, the organisation of songs is often based on an artist’s overall genre, rather than on the feeling generated by a song.

Goal 
This project aims to increase conscious listing to improve personal well-being by using engineering methods to create an algorithm that classifies music according to psychologist Robert Thayer’s traditional model of mood.
